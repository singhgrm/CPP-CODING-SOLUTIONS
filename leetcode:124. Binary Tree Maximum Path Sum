/*A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. 
A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.*/
