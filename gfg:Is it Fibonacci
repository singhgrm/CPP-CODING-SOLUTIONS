/*Geek just learned about Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

He defines a new series called Geeky numbers. Here the next number is the sum of the K preceding numbers.
You are given an array of size K, GeekNum[ ], where the ith element of the array represents the ith Geeky number. Return its Nth term.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6, K = 1
GeekNum[] = {4}
Output: 
4
Explanation: 
Terms are 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4

long long solve(int n, int k, vector<long long>arr) {
vector<long long int>dp(n,0);
if(n<=k)
{
    return arr[n-1];
}
for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
{
    dp[i]=arr[i];
}
for(int i=k;i<n;i++)
{
    for(int j=i-1;j>=i-k;j--)
    {
        dp[i]+=dp[j];
    }
}
return dp[n-1];
    }
