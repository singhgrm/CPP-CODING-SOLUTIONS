/*Given two numbers a and b. In one operation you can pick any non negative integer x and either of a or b.
Now if you picked a then replace a with a&x else if you picked b then replace b with b&x.

Return the minimum number of operation required to make a and b equal.

Note: Here & represents bitwise AND operation.

Example 1:

Input:
a = 5, b = 12
Output:
2
Explanantion:
In first operation replace 
a = a&4 = 4
after that replace 
b = b&6 = 4*/
int solve(int a, int b) {
if(a==b)
{
    return 0;
}
int val=a&b;
if(val!=a && val!=b)
{
    return 2;
}
return 1;
    }
